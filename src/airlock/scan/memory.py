"""Scan MCP-exposed memory for injection.

Persistent memory reached through MCP - a memory server, a knowledge graph, a vector store -
is an injection surface the other scanners miss: content written once is recalled as trusted
in every later session (MINJA-class memory poisoning). Unlike `scan` (which never calls a
tool, only reads declared descriptions), this DELIBERATELY calls the memory READ tools to
retrieve what is already stored and runs the same injection detectors over it, so a poisoned
memory is caught before it is recalled into an agent's context and acted on.

It calls only tools classified as memory reads (`classify_memory_tool`), with a small set of
broad argument shapes, and never calls write/other tools.
