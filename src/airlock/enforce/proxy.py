"""Client-side enforcing proxy: the trust boundary as a drop-in middleware.

The convention only protects end to end when the consuming client honors it. Rather
than wait for every client vendor to adopt it, this proxy sits between an unmodified
MCP client and an upstream server and enforces the contract on the consuming side.
The client points at the proxy as if it were the server; the proxy connects to the
real server, applies the reference enforcer to every Resource body, Prompt message,
and tool output, and returns the enforced result. Untrusted content arrives at the
model demarcated as data, quarantined content is withheld, and only trusted content
that verifies passes through as authoritative.

This collapses the two-sided adoption problem to one side. It needs no client change,
and because the enforcer fails closed, it protects even against a server that emits no
provenance at all: absent provenance is treated as untrusted and demoted to data. A
server that does tag its content only makes the boundary more precise.

Built on the low-level MCP Server so the proxy controls exactly what it emits. The
upstream capabilities are mirrored: the proxy advertises only the primitives the
upstream actually exposes.
