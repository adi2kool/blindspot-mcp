"""The flight recorder: a signed, tamper-evident, append-only provenance audit trail.

Every enforcement decision and every action-gate/approval decision the proxy makes is
recorded as one entry in a hash-chained log. Each entry's `entry_hash` covers the
previous entry's hash, so editing or deleting any past entry breaks the chain from that
point forward and `verify_chain` detects it. Entries MAY additionally be Ed25519-signed
by the operator, so a verifier with the operator's public key can confirm the log was
produced by the holder of the key and not forged wholesale.

This is the free, local primitive: a JSONL file on disk, no network, no service. The
`Ledger` write path and the `verify_chain` read path are the stable seam; a hosted,
searchable transparency log with compliance-report export is a drop-in replacement for
the sink that consumes these same entries, and is the future paid control plane.

Why this is unique: it fuses the two capabilities only airlock has - runtime content
provenance and content signing - into a verifiable record of what actually flowed and
what was authorized. Competitors block flows; only this attests to them.
