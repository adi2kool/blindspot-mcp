"""The shared invisible-unicode sanitizer.

One source of truth for the invisible-unicode knowledge, used by both the Phase 1
scanner (to detect) and the Phase 2 provenance library (to strip at emit time), so
the scanner and the tagger share one sanitizer.

`strip_invisible` removes every invisible/format character, not just a hand-picked
list: any Unicode `Cf` (format) character, plus the variation-selector ranges, plus
the Unicode Tag block. Tag characters are additionally decoded back to the ASCII
they carried, for reporting. This is deliberately aggressive: untrusted content has
no legitimate need for format controls (including ZWJ emoji sequences or bidi
marks), and letting any of them survive into the emitted body would let a hidden
instruction ride into the hash and the model's context. Homoglyphs are NOT rewritten
here: they are visible characters and silently normalizing them would corrupt
legitimate non-Latin text; homoglyphs are handled by detection and quarantine.
