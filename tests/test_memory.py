"""Provenance for MCP-exposed memory.

Persistent memory reached through MCP is an injection surface the other scanners miss:
content written once is recalled as trusted in every later session (MINJA-class). These
tests cover the three parts: `scan-memory` finds a poisoned entry already in the store; the
proxy gates a poisoning WRITE once the session is tainted (block) so the poison never
persists; and in annotate mode it tags what is persisted so a later recall attributes it as
untrusted-origin.
