"""Regression tests for the confirmed findings of the performance + security audit.

Each test pins a specific vulnerability the adversarial audit found and that was fixed, so a
future refactor cannot silently reopen it. The critical action-gate split-lock (a concurrency
TOCTOU) and the coupled nested-sampling deadlock are exercised by the existing
test_proxy_sampling suite (sampling fired DURING a call under --on-action block would hang if
the callbacks re-acquired the handler's lock, and completes only because they share one lock
and the callbacks taint without it); the deterministic findings are pinned here.
