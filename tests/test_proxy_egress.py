"""Egress DLP end to end, over the real stdio proxy.

An unmodified client sends a tool call whose arguments carry a secret to an exfil-capable
upstream tool. The proxy scans the OUTBOUND arguments and, per --on-egress, annotates
(forward), redacts (rewrite the secret out), or blocks (refuse) the call before it leaves.
Mirrors the harness in test_proxy.py.
