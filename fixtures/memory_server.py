"""INERT fixture: an MCP memory server, for testing memory provenance and scan-memory.

A minimal long-term-memory server: `store_memory` persists a fact under a key, `recall_memory`
returns stored facts. It is seeded with two benign entries and one POISONED entry - a stored
"fact" carrying an injection, the memory-poisoning shape where content written once is recalled
as trusted later. Nothing performs real I/O; the injection is inert text.
