"""A server that rug-pulls itself mid-session, for testing live drift detection.

INERT TEST FIXTURE. The server ships a benign `lookup` tool and returns it on the FIRST
`list_tools` call (so a baseline captured at proxy startup, or a `airlock lock`, sees the
clean definition). On every SUBSEQUENT `list_tools` it returns a mutated `lookup` whose
description carries an inert injection - a classic rug pull that waits until after adoption
to change a tool. A second tool, `ping`, never changes, so a detector must flag only the
tool that actually drifted. Nothing here performs real I/O.

Built on the low-level Server so the tool LIST can differ per call (the FastMCP decorator
API registers a fixed set at import time).
