# Airlock

The instruction and data boundary for MCP.

## Thesis

Agents cannot reliably tell trusted instructions from untrusted data, because a
model reads system instructions, user input, and retrieved content as one token
stream with no enforced boundary between them. Anything that reaches the context
can act like a command. Airlock makes that boundary explicit and enforceable at
the MCP layer.

- A scanner finds where the boundary is violated (the on-ramp).
- A provenance library lets a server author mark the trust level of what it emits
  (the centerpiece, server side).
- A reference client enforcer keeps untrusted content out of the instruction path
  on the consuming side (the centerpiece, client side).
- An adaptive-attack evaluation measures how well the boundary holds under an
  attacker who knows how it works (the proof).

The differentiator is author-side provenance plus a client enforcement contract,
not content moderation. See [`spec/convention.md`](spec/convention.md) for the
proposed convention, [`docs/positioning.md`](docs/positioning.md) for where it sits
in the landscape, and [`docs/prevalence-findings.md`](docs/prevalence-findings.md)
for a scan of ~1,000 real MCP servers.

## Status

Phase 1 (the on-ramp), Phase 2 (the trust-boundary centerpiece), and the Phase 3
adaptive-attack evaluation are complete.

- Phase 1: a scanner for the neglected surfaces (Prompts, Resources, and Tool
  descriptions, including tool parameter descriptions - the tool-poisoning vector) with
  local pattern and invisible-unicode detection and an optional local-model judge; a
  labeled benchmark reporting precision, recall, and false-positive rate against a
  stated bar; and a least-privilege auditor.
- Phase 2: the provenance convention (`spec/convention.md`, `spec/schema.json`), a
  server-side tagging library (with optional signing that authenticates the trust
  label - HMAC-SHA256 or Ed25519, so a client verifies with a published public key), a
  client-side reference enforcer (with authoritative-path sanitization), an enforcing
  proxy that applies the contract for an unmodified client (optionally with LLM-inferred
  provenance for untagged servers, and optional active gating that blocks or holds a
  side-effecting tool call once untrusted content is in the session), sanitized-rewrite
  remediation, and drift / rug-pull detection.
- Phase 3: the adaptive-attack harness (`src/airlock/redteam/`) attacks the
  reference defense as an adversary who knows how it works. Across 56 verified
  attacks the defense holds: every in-scope attack (naive and adaptive) fails, and
  only the documented residuals succeed - five attacks, all of two root causes (a
  malicious server labeling its own content, and an active in-transit relabel without
  a signature). Plus cross-server composition analysis
  (`src/airlock/compose.py`): it flags when a set of individually-clean servers
  jointly enables the lethal trifecta (private-data access plus untrusted content
  plus an exfiltration path). Remaining: the prevalence study over real servers,
  which stays gated behind responsible disclosure.

The enforcement surface has since been extended in three directions:

- Reverse-channel enforcement: the proxy also enforces the two server->client channels
  (sampling `createMessage` and `elicitation`), framing server-supplied text as data,
  never leaving a server system prompt in the instruction region, and refusing them under
  `--on-sampling block` / `--on-elicitation block` (`--on-elicitation` always declines the
  URL-mode phishing vector).
- Continuous (mid-session) rug-pull detection: with `--lock` or `--pin-on-start` the proxy
  re-checks the surface on every list and forwarded `list_changed`, not just at startup, so
  a server that mutates a tool after adoption is caught live - tainting the session and (under
  `--on-drift block`) withholding the mutated definition and refusing a call to it.
- Provenance for MCP-exposed memory: `scan-memory` finds injection already persisted in a
  memory server, the proxy gates a poisoning memory WRITE once the session is tainted, and
  tags what is persisted so a later recall attributes it as untrusted-origin.

Runs at $0. The only optional network dependency is a local open-source model for
the semantic judge; without one, the scanner degrades to local-only detection.
Nothing is sent off the machine.

## Install

```bash
pip install airlock-mcp          # provides the `airlock` command
uvx airlock-mcp proxy path/to/server.py --on-action block   # or run without installing
docker run --rm ghcr.io/adi2kool/airlock-mcp --help
```

Point your MCP client at `airlock proxy <server>` instead of the server and it is protected
end to end, with zero server changes. See [`docs/deploy.md`](docs/deploy.md) for copy-paste
recipes (Claude Desktop, Cursor, Docker).

## Requirements

- Python 3.11 or newer (developed on 3.12).
- `uv` for local development; `pip`/`uvx` for install.
- MCP Python SDK, pinned to `mcp>=1.28,<2` (stable v1.x).
- Optional: a local [Ollama](https://ollama.com) server for the semantic judge.

## CLI

```bash

# Scan a server's tool descriptions, prompts, and resources for injection (human / JSON / SARIF),
# with sanitized-rewrite remediation. Add --judge on for the optional local judge.
uv run airlock scan  fixtures/vulnerable_server.py
uv run airlock scan  fixtures/vulnerable_server.py --format sarif --sarif out.sarif

# Statically scan a server's SOURCE tree for injectable declared strings (tool/prompt
# descriptions) WITHOUT executing it. The safe way to analyze an untrusted server.
uv run airlock scan-source path/to/server/src

# Flag capabilities a server advertises but does not exercise.
uv run airlock audit fixtures/vulnerable_server.py

# Scan an MCP memory server's STORED entries for injection. Persistent memory reached
# through MCP is a poisoning surface the other scanners miss: content written once is
# recalled as trusted later. This calls the server's recall tools and runs the detectors
# over what is actually persisted, catching a poisoned memory before it is recalled.
uv run airlock scan-memory fixtures/memory_server.py

# Read a server's provenance and run the client enforcer over it. Injected content
# is demoted to data or quarantined and is never instruction-eligible.
uv run airlock guard fixtures/tagged_server.py

# Run an enforcing PROXY in front of a server. An unmodified MCP client points at the
# proxy instead of the server and is protected end to end: untrusted content arrives
# framed as data, even from a server that emits no provenance at all. This is how the
# boundary works without waiting for client vendors to adopt the convention.
uv run airlock proxy fixtures/vulnerable_server.py

# Add --infer to classify untagged content with a local model (Ollama by default, $0)
# so the proxy explains WHY each item is treated as data instead of blanket-framing
# everything. It fails safe: with no model reachable, untagged content stays untrusted.
uv run airlock proxy fixtures/vulnerable_server.py --infer

# Actively gate side-effecting tool calls. Once untrusted content has entered the
# session, a call to a tool that can send data outward (email/post/upload/HTTP) is
# held for approval (--on-action approve) or refused (--on-action block) BEFORE it
# reaches the upstream, so an injection cannot drive exfiltration. Default is annotate
# (forward, record the disposition), which is backward compatible.
uv run airlock proxy fixtures/vulnerable_server.py --on-action block

# Enforce the REVERSE (server->client) channels too. A server can push text into the
# client's own LLM via sampling (createMessage) or a coercive prompt to the user via
# elicitation. The proxy frames that server-supplied text as data, never leaves a server
# system prompt in the instruction region, taints the session, and records each request.
# --on-sampling/--on-elicitation block refuses them outright (stops sampling credit-drain);
# URL-mode elicitation (the phishing vector) is always declined.

# For a raw --key you must declare its algorithm (--key-alg ed25519 for a public key),

# LIVE rug-pull detection: the proxy re-checks the surface on every list, not just at
# startup, so a server that mutates a tool AFTER adoption is caught mid-session. With a
# --lock the drifted definition is withheld and a call to it is refused (--on-drift block);
# with --pin-on-start (trust-on-first-use, no lock) drift taints the session (--on-drift

`fixtures/tagged_server.py` is a conforming server that emits provenance `_meta`;
`fixtures/vulnerable_server.py` is a poisoned server with no provenance, which the
enforcer treats as untrusted and fails closed on.

## Safety

Every attack payload in this repository is an inert fixture. Nothing performs
network, email, or filesystem I/O against a real target. The scanner is not pointed
at any third-party server. See `fixtures/README.md` for the payload inventory and
the inert-sink statement.
